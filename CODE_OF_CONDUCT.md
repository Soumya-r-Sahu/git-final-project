# Code of Conduct

Welcome to the Simple Interest Calculator project!

I want this project to be a friendly and respectful space for learning and contribution.  
Everyone participating is expected to show kindness, patience, and professionalism.

If you notice any inappropriate behavior, please report it by contacting the project maintainer.

Inspired by the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct v2.1](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/).
